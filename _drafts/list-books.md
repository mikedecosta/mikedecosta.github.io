* [Clean Code](#clean-code)
* [How to Design Programs](#how-to-design-programs)

This is my curated list of books that I read frequently and recommend to all software engineers.

Taking a page out of the book by John Sonmez, I'll be curating my own list of recommended software engineering books that every programmer should read.

## Clean Code
*A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship*  
I recommend reading and rereading this book every couple years to reinforce the concepts contained within. You can see my full book review here:

## How to Design Programs
*An introduction to Programming and Computing*  
This was my computer science 101 textbook and I think this is the ideal way to learn and approach software program design. This is the long road to becoming a programmer but if you have the time and patience, I would pick up this book first, even if just for the design recipe chapter.
