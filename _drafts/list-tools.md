This is my curated list of tools that I use to get the most out of my time.

* [go/links](#go/golinks)
* [multiple workspaces](#multiple-workspaces)
* [LastPass](#last-pass)

## [go/links](https://www.golinks.io/)
Go links is great for any organization that wants to share resources. If you have people constantly asking things like

  * *"What's the payroll dashboard link again?"*
  * *"Where are the 401k forms?"*
  * *"Where are the docs for that external plug-in we wrote?"*

It's an amazing resource for on-boarding new team members. Just point em to the go links page and it will have all the links that the team uses and push most used links to the top.

## Multiple Workspaces
So many times I sit next to another developer and they go to show me something, pull up their browser and it's got over 35 tabs up. Trying to switch into what they actually want at that time takes a few tries because more than likely, the app your working on is open in multiple tabs for multiple contexts at once and they all share the same icon (which is the only thing visible with that many tabs open)

Start to compartmentalize things you're working on into different workspaces. It's like having extra monitors that you can shove related stuff onto, and not worry about it when you're not working on that part, but still need it open to switch to later.

Here is my current setup. I have 4 workspaces that I can easily switch to with hot-keys. Everything is contained in a virtual wrapped line of spaces. (going left to right 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, ...)
  1. Workspace 1 is my main working window. It keeps my main focus and what is most important to get done.
  2. Workspace 2 is some other side objective that I also am working on simultaneously. Maybe when workspace 1 is building, or tests are running.
  3. Workspace 3 usually ends up being [personal space](https://i.imgur.com/ELU1Vy7.jpg)
  4. Workspace 4 I use for my communication hub. It's where I keep slack, my email, and anything directly related to those interactions.

## [Last Pass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
Stop trying to remember and write down secure passwords. (Or worse, using one password for everything.) LastPass will let you remember exactly 1 very secure password to generate, store, and even systematically share passwords to all your other logins. It can even store notes like social-security numbers that you can share with your significant other so they never have to ask when filling out those beneficiary forms. It also means when going to different devices, your passwords go with you. No need to set-up all your logins again, just login to LastPass and you're good to go, and it works on mobile devices.
