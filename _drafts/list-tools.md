This is my curated list of tools that I use to get the most out of my work.

* [go links](#go-golinks)

## go links - https://www.golinks.io/
Go links is great for any organization that wants to share resources. If you have people constantly asking things like

  * *"What's the payroll dashboard link again?"*
  * *"Where are the 401k forms?"*
  * *"where are the docs for that external plug-in we wrote?"*

It's an amazing resource for on-boarding new team members. Just point em to the go links page and it will have all the links that the team uses and push most used links to the top.
